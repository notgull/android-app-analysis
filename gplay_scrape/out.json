Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. <br><br>SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use.

This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number.

You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.

With one free download, you get an everyday private Internet browser that offers seamless protection while you search and browse, and access to tracking protection for emails you receive and apps you use. Many of these protections are not offered in most popular web browsers by default.<br> <br>FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS<br><b>Search Privately by Default</b> DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.<br> <br><b>Block Tracking Cookies While Browsing</b> Prevent most 3rd-party Internet cookies from tracking you as you browse online.<br> <br><b>Escape Website Trackers Before They Load</b> Automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using any personal data from these trackers. Stay secure with our cutting-edge tracker-blocking technology – 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, which goes above and beyond what you get in most popular web browsers by default.<br> <br><b>Automatically Enforce Encryption</b><br>Force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider.<br> <br><b>Block Email Trackers (Beta)</b><br>Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses (@duck.com) contain trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.<br> <br><b>Protect Your Privacy in Other Apps (Beta)</b><br>Block most hidden app trackers in other apps day or night, and prevent third-party companies from invading your privacy with App Tracking Protection. This feature uses a VPN connection, but is not a VPN. It works locally on your device and does not collect personal data.<br> <br><b>Escape Fingerprinting</b><br>Help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your web browser and device settings.<br> <br><b>Block Tracking Cookies</b><br>Prevent most third-party cookies from tracking you as you browse online from website to website.<br> <br>We feature many protections not available on most Internet browsers (even incognito browsers), including protection from link tracking, Google AMP tracking, and more.<br> <br>EVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS<br><b>Tap Fire Button, Burn Data</b><br>Clear your tabs and browsing data fast with our Fire Button.<br> <br><b>Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC)</b><br>Built in to our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.<br> <br>Note about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.<br> <br>Read more about this and our free Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections",

Each identification offers a comprehensive overview of the coin, including its name, country of origin, year of issue, coin populations, and many more. <br><br>What is more, the app has a coin grading feature and gives a reference price for each coin. With this data, you will be able to easily determine the value of your coin and make informed numismatic purchases, sales, and trading decisions. <br><br>Furthermore, you can record and store your collections directly within the CoinSnap app, so you never lose track of your collectibles and are always aware of the value of what you have. The app also permits you to arrange your collections by coin series.<br><br>Key Features:<br>- Identify any coins from around the world with a quick snap<br>- Give accurate identification results<br>- Identify rare coins and error coins<br>- Grade coins via photos<br>- Estimate the price of identified coins to understand the value of your coin<br>- Stay up to date with trendy coin collection series<br>- Record and store your collections right in the app<br>- Track the total value of all your coins<br>- High-resolution photography <br><br>CoinSnap is the perfect app for coin enthusiasts of all levels.

Watch full episodes, stream on your iPhone, iPad or cast to your TV — nothing required!<br><br>The Chosen is the first-ever multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus.

No matter where you are in your journey with Jesus Christ, this TV show is for you.<br><br><br>MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR<br><br>I’ve been a believer my whole life, I’ve attended Christian schools my whole life, and I’ve heard the stories of Jesus countless times. I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?<br><br>Because I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I&#39;ve heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.<br><br>So when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.<br><br>One of our favorite responses from an early screening? &quot;The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!&quot;<br>No matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.<br><br>We hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did.",

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.",

This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.

Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.<br> <br>Read more about this and our free Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections",

I’ve also seen every Jesus movie and miniseries ever made, and there have been dozens. So why a new TV show about Jesus?<br><br>Because I have a passion for people to hear the “old, old story” again … for the very first time. When I see Jesus movies, it’s sometimes hard for me to feel moved or excited. I&#39;ve heard the stories before, and many Jesus projects just take you from Bible story to Bible story, not spending as much time on the humanity and backstories of all these characters. And they sometimes feel stiff and formal.<br><br>So when we started to write a show that explores Jesus through the eyes of those around Him, we were repeatedly moved and excited. We explored the backstories of Simon Peter, Matthew, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, and a few of Jesus’ miracle recipients, and in turn experienced Him in the way they did. We couldn’t help but identify with their recklessness, rough pasts, religious piety, and desperation for life change. And ultimately, their redemption.<br><br>One of our favorite responses from an early screening? &quot;The story of Jesus that actually appealed to my teenagers!&quot;<br>No matter where you’re at in your journey with Christ—whether you’re one of the many people in the gospels who encountered Jesus after a horrific past without Him, or you’re a Nicodemus who’s been a lifelong member of the God team—Jesus proved over and over that we have so much to learn and innumerable traits that need change.<br><br>We hope this show allows you to see Jesus as they did.",

Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.<br><br>  <b>Manage and secure your child’s account</b><br>  • Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device.<br>  • Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child&#39;s account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.<br><br>  <b>Stay connected on the go</b><br>  • See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.<br>  • Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.<br><br><br>  <b>Important Information</b><br><br>  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/<br>  • While Family Link helps you manage your child&#39;s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.<br>  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.<br>  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.<br>  • Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.<br>  • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.",

If someone in your area is providing a feed that contains both police and fire you could provide a feed that contains only police, only fire, or one that covers only certain districts/precincts.  Next, go to Broadcastify.com&#39;s web site and click on the Broadcast button to sign-up (it&#39;s completely free) to provide scanner audio for your area.

Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.<br><br>Individual Internet users may secure their transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.",
